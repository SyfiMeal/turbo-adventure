**Important:** Chrome will be removing support for Chrome Apps on all platforms. Chrome browser and
the Chrome Web Store will continue to support extensions. [**Read the announcement**][1] and learn
more about [**migrating your app**][2].

!!!

Several graphically intense interactive application frameworks / game engines exist that target web
technologies. The following are some we recommend with instructions for producing a Chrome App.

## PlayCanvas {: #playcanvas }

PlayCanvas is a free and open source WebGL Game Engine targeting mobile and desktop. Its browser
based development tools support real-time collaboration.

PlayCanvas exports content that requires a small amount of manual work to package into a Chrome App.
See: [PlayCanvas Packaged App Publishing Documentation][8].

## WiMi5 {: #WiMi5 }

WiMi5 demo on Chrome Web Store: [Bakus Legend][10][][11]

WiMi5 is a free cloud based webapp to create, publish and monetize web games. Games are quickly
developed using a visual scripting editor. Programming is not required.

WiMi5 can create a package for Chrome Web Store with 1-click. See: [How to publish your game on the
Chrome Web][14].
