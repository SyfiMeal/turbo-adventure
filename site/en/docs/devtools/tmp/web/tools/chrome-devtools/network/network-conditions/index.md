It's easy to overlook the network conditions your users will face on mobile. Use DevTools to emulate
different network conditions. Fix any load time issues and your users will thank you.

## TL;DR {: #tldr }

- Without affecting traffic to other tabs, evaluate your site''s performance using the Chrome
  DevTools network emulator.
- Use custom profiles that are specific to your audiences network conditions.

## Emulate network connectivity {: #emulate_network_connectivity }

Network conditioning allows you to test your site on a variety of network connections, including
Edge, 3G, and even offline. It throttles the maximum download and upload throughput (rate of data
transfer). Latency manipulation enforces a minimum delay in connection round-trip time (RTT).

Network Conditioning is turned on through the Network panel. Select a connection from the dropdown
to apply network throttling and latency manipulation.

**Tip**: You can also set network throttles via the [Network conditions][2] drawer.

When a Throttle is enabled the panel indicator will show a warning icon. This is to remind you that
throttling is enabled when you are in other panels.

DevTools provides a solid foundation of default conditions. You may need to add custom conditions to
cover your audiences primary conditions.

To add a condition open the dropdown to apply a condition. Under the **custom** header find and
select the **Add...** option. This will open the DevTools settings dialog with the "Throttling" tab
open.

First, click the **Add custom profile** button. This opens an inline form to supply the profiles
conditions. Accurately fill the form out then press the **Add** button when it meets your needs.

**Delete** icons are shown to the right of the entry.

header to select a condition.
