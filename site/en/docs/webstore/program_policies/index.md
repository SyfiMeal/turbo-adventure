      Extensions must be marketed responsibly. When developers copy someone else's work or deceive users, it hurts users and the developer community. Don't rely on misleading behavior or unfair use of other people's work.

      Developers are important partners in maintaining a great user experience in the Chrome Web Store. Your extensions should include features, content, and UI that provide unique value to the Chrome Web Store. At a minimum, extensions should provide users with a basic degree of functionality and a respectful user experience. We may reject extensions unless they provide a unique, high-quality experience. Spamming the store may lead to your removal as a developer from the Chrome web Store.

## Best Practices and Guidelines
To help ensure the best experience for both users and developers, please review
the below guidelines prior to submitting your extension to the Chrome Web Store.
Following all of these guidelines doesnâ€™t mean your extension will be
automatically approved, but they will help you to avoid common mistakes that
often delay the review process.

- Extensions should add value to the Chrome Web Store. If your extension is not particularly useful or unique, it doesn't belong on the Chrome Web Store

- No cheating. If you attempt to scam the system (for example, by misleading users, circumventing enforcement, copying the work of other developers, or manipulating your extension's reviews or ratings) you will be banned from the Chrome Web Store

- Ensure that all of your extension's information and metadata are up to date and accurate

- Test your extensions for crashes, broken features, and bugs prior to submission

- Verify that your contact information is correct to ensure you receive important communications for the Chrome Web Store.

- Include detailed information in the single purpose field regarding your extension's primary functionality.

- Provide meaningful customer support for your extension

- Versioning - use the most up to date version
