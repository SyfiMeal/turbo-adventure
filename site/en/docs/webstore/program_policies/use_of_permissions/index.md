1.  Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary to implement your Product's features or services. If more than one permission could be used to implement a feature, you must request those with the least access to data or functionality.

1.  Don't attempt to "future proof" your Product by requesting a permission that might benefit services or features that have not yet been implemented.
